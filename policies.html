<h1>Shipping, Return & Refund Policy</h1>
<p>Processing time for crafting all standard orders is approximately 10 days, depending on the amount of items and the complexity of the work. Delays can happen if the store gets an overwhelming amount of orders in a short period of time, or due to personal issues. We are a two-person company, and life is unpredictable. As a small business it's impossible to avoid inconveniences from time to time. We always provide updates and photos of the items once they're prepared, as well as the packaging process, to the email you provided when finishing your order.</p>
<p>Refunds are only available within 24 hours from the moment of purchase if the order was placed during a business day, within 72 hours if placed during the day before a weekend, and within 48 hours if placed during the day before a holiday. After that time, accordingly to our schedule, the order preparations or even item crafting process will have already started, so we no longer can accept refunds. All items are made by hand by one person, unique and customized for each customer, so they can't be possibly used for restocking. As a small business, the time, labour, and materials that contribute to fulfilling an order are significant resources. Your understanding contributes to processing orders and providing thoughtful, timely customer service.</p>
<p>We ship worldwide and to all international destinations, to any address provided, including PO boxes and gifts to other people. International delivery times vary between 2 weeks and 2 months depending on your location, the most common time being 3 weeks. We cannot guarantee delivery times, and it can take more time depending on the situation of your country, or delivery service logistics problems that are outside of our control.</p>
<p>All orders shipped are sent via standard Brazilian Post, which is the most reliable, simple and cheap option available to us, but alternative shipping methods can be discussed if of interest (all fees must be paid by the buyer). We always provide the tracking link to the email you provided when finishing your order, that can be checked worldwide for real-time updates. In case of losing the tracking link, contact us by email, providing your order id: <b>shybunny@middlepot.com</b> . In case of losing the order id as well as contacting with a different email from the one specified in your order, we can't possibly be of any help.</p>
<p>If the international shipping services that we use are not currently open for your country, we will display a warn for you on the /bag page before you place your order (based on the country you are in while navigating our website), and we also warn all customers about it through order updates emails. Since we can't be sure if the shipping services will return promptly or not, order preparations follow crafting time and packaging process normally, so please be aware of the refund deadline.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for shipping delays and issues caused by completely or partially closed countries due to the covid-19 pandemic, natural disasters or other similar issues. If not possible to ship or packages are returned, we will keep them here standing by until we are able to ship correctly and safely. If desired, we can arrange an alternative shipping method (all fees must be paid by the buyer). Please make sure to check your country situation carefully beforehand, for avoiding nuisances.</p>
<p>The buyer agrees that they are responsible for any duty, taxes, and expenses associated with importing products purchased from us when shipping internationally. Any extra taxes and duties are the sole responsibility of the purchaser, these fees are not included in the shipping costs.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for delays or issues caused by customs or country-specific requirements, such as extra documentation not previously informed to us. If any extra forms are needed we will certainly make sure to fill these properly, if we are duly informed about it in the post office. Shipping times may exceed the estimate, while customs bureaucracy can turn out inconvenient at times, due to factors outside of our control.</p>
<p>We are not responsible if any packages are refused or returned for any reason. We will contact the customer about it and kindly ask for the applicable shipping fee for resending the package. However, if the fee can't be paid, we are okay with paying to resend the package, if the applicable fee is the minimum amount, which is currently $5 USD worldwide. As the items are handmade unique and can't be possibly used for restocking, there is no point in making this process difficult, so we are always willing to discuss the reshipping situation and solve it thoroughly.</p>
<p>We are not responsible if a package is lost or stolen in shipment (which is an extremely rare and unfortunate situation). If a package shows that it has been delivered through the tracking number and the customer is unable to locate their package, we are not responsible and will not issue a refund. The products covered by each contract (i.e. accepted order) are at your risk upon delivery of the order to the carrier.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that an item is damaged during shipping, please send an email including a photo of the damage directly upon arrival to arrange a compensation, depending on the severity of the situation.</p>
